# Introduction

Langutil is a very flexible tool for localizing in JavaScript. It also works with React and React Native.

The core of langutil is now exposed as a class. The package ships with one that's ready to use out of the box, but in rare cases where you need a separate core for special tasks, it is now possible.

# Important Notes
This package is created to replace [langutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langutil). The old langutil tried to do too many things and end up being bloated and hard to maintain. The new langutil aims just to do a few things and do it right.
